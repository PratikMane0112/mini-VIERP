Dear Mr./Ms.,

Sub: Warning Letter.
This is to inform you that your child Harry Potter has been continually failing to attend his/her class.
The total attendance is 50.00% which is less than the 75% criteria of the college.
Several warnings were issued to your child in the past, but you have failed to address this matter.
We expect you to take immediate and serious action to help your child improve his/her attendance 
and expect to see some positive results by the end of this month. 
Our teachers are available for assistance in this regard should you require any help in bringing
about a significant improvement in your child's attendance.



Thank you.								Signature
